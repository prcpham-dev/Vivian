Focus on finding:
1. Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, credentials in plaintext)
2. Exposed credentials (database passwords, AWS keys, GitHub tokens, OAuth secrets)
3. Hardcoded encryption keys or private keys
4. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) exposure without encryption
5. Logging of sensitive data (passwords, credit cards, SSNs in logs)
6. Unencrypted sensitive data storage (passwords in plaintext, unencrypted databases)
7. Weak or missing encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit
8. Exposed environment variables or configuration files with secrets
9. Sensitive data in error messages or stack traces
10. Backup files containing sensitive information
11. Credentials in code comments or documentation

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide the exact line number for each vulnerability found. Analyze the code content carefully and identify the specific line where the sensitive data is exposed.

Return JSON array of vulnerabilities found. Each entry MUST include: line (integer line number, not null), type (string - e.g., "Hardcoded API Key", "Plaintext Password"), severity (high/medium/low), description (string - concise one sentence explanation), location (file path).

DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS: The description field must be concise and informative, explaining what the vulnerability is and why it's a security risk in a single sentence. Do NOT suggest specific code fixes - only describe the security issue and its risks. Keep it to exactly one sentence."""
