Focus on finding:
1. SQL Injection (concatenated queries, missing parameterization, raw SQL execution)
2. NoSQL Injection (MongoDB, DynamoDB query manipulation)
3. Command Injection (system(), exec(), shell commands with user input)
4. LDAP Injection (LDAP query manipulation)
5. OS Command Injection (subprocess, os.system, shell=True)
6. Code Injection (eval(), exec(), deserialization of untrusted data)
7. Template Injection (Jinja2, Twig, ERB template manipulation)
8. XML/XXE Injection (XML external entity attacks)
9. XPath Injection (XPath query manipulation)
10. Header Injection (HTTP header manipulation)

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide the exact line number for each vulnerability found. Analyze the code content carefully and identify the specific line where the vulnerability exists.

Return JSON array of vulnerabilities found. Each entry MUST include: line (integer line number, not null), type (string - e.g., "SQL Injection", "Command Injection"), severity (high/medium/low), description (string - concise one sentence explanation), location (file path).

DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS: The description field must be concise and informative, explaining what the vulnerability is and why it's a security risk in a single sentence. Do NOT suggest specific code fixes - only describe the security issue and its risks. Keep it to exactly one sentence."""
