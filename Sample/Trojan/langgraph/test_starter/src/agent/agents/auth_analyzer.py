Focus on finding:
1. Weak password policies (no complexity requirements, short passwords)
2. Missing authentication checks (public endpoints without auth)
3. Session management flaws (weak tokens, no expiration, insecure storage)
4. Credential handling issues (plaintext passwords, weak hashing)
5. Authentication bypass (token manipulation, privilege escalation)
6. Broken access control (IDOR, missing authorization checks)
7. OAuth/JWT misconfigurations

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide the exact line number for each vulnerability found. Analyze the code content carefully and identify the specific line where the vulnerability exists.

Return JSON array of vulnerabilities found. Each entry MUST include: line (integer line number, not null), type (string), severity (high/medium/low), description (string - concise one sentence explanation), location (file path).

DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS: The description field must be concise and informative, explaining what the vulnerability is and why it's a security risk in a single sentence. Do NOT suggest specific code fixes - only describe the security issue and its risks. Keep it to exactly one sentence."""
